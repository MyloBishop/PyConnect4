# PyConnect4
A Connect 4 engine built in Python.


vvv Tests right now are just a proof of concept, the connect 4 board works (i think)
Let GH actions in the future run the AI benchmark, flake8 + mypy
For example, show if the AI Evaluation is correct ("passing") and it runs as many tests as it can in say 5 minutes allowed.
We can then setup this action to report how many tests ran and the success. Maybe a seperate action for flake8 and mypy?
